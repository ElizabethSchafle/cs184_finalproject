<h2 align="left">Final Report</h2>
<h3 align="left">Abstract</h3>
<p>Our project is about downsampling and remeshing triangle meshes. The goal for downsampling is to reduce the number
  of triangles used to represent the shape of the mesh. The main difficulty is reducing the triangles, which is done
  with edge collapse. Edge collapse is then used in Quadric Error Metric downsampling. </p>
<p>
  The goal for isotropic remeshing is finding a better, discrete representation of a mesh with triangles of equal edge
  length. The main difficulty is adjusting edge lengths which is done by calculating new positions for vertices.
</p>
<h3 align="left">Technical Approach</h3>

<h4>
  Edge Collapse: (Implemented by Brian Ho)
</h4>
<p>This algorithm is arguably the most cruicial function for the project, utilized in both mesh downsampling and
  remeshing. What edge collapse does is take a selected edge, and gets rid of it as well as merge the two vertices.
  Our algorithm is as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new vertex as the midpoint of the endpoints of the edge.</li>
  <li>Save pointers of half-edges, edges, faces and vertices.</li>
  <li>Make the half-edges of the vertices point to the new vertex by iterating through all of the half-edges.</li>
  <li>Delete unwanted faces, halfedges, and edges, and also delete the two vertices at the endpoints of the original
    edge (making sure nothing is pointing to these objects).</li>
  <li>Return the new vertex.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a basic diagram of out algorithm that we had originally based our implementation off of; however,
  we had to make some changes due to unforseen segmentation faults and allocation errors:</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Here is our implementation of iterating around the right vertex, and changing all of the half-edge pointers to
  now point to the midpoint vertex if they were originally pointing to the right vertex. We do the same process to
  the left vertex (not shown), and do this in order to delete the two vertices without running into
  further pointer problems.</p>

<h4>
  Quadric Error Simplification: (Implemented by Jose Chavez)
</h4>
<p>The key to downsampling a mesh is to reduce the amount of triangles to the extent that the overall shape of the mesh is preserved. If we had a cow in our scene, but far away, we want less triangles while still having the shape of the cow. We can downsample using our handy edge collapse method, which helps delete faces and edges. Moreover, we preserve the shape of the mesh by minimizing the error between a downsampled surface resulting from an edge collapse and the original surface. Thus the overall algorithm would be to iteratively collapse edges that minimize this surface error until a target number of triangles is reached. I will elaborate on the idea of a quadric error. To define Quadric Errors, we used the paper "Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics" by Garland and Heckbert and the developer guide found on CMU's assignment page.</p>
<p>In order to minimize a resulting vertex's distance to the plane of the original mesh after an edge collapse, we need an equation that gives us the distance to a plane. With this, each face is going to have a derived plane equation that uses its normal $N = (a, b, c)$ and a vertex $p = (x, y, z)$ in the triangle. The plane equation $ax + by + cz + d$ where $d = N \cdot p$ thus gives us a way to represent a plane in a 4D homogenous vector $(a, b, c, d)$. If we have a point $u$ in 4D homogenous space and a 4D plane vector $v$, the distance from $u$ to $v$ is thus $u \cdot v$. Since we only care how far $u$ is from the plane and not whether it is below or above $v$, we want to square this value. This gives us $(u \cdot v)^2 = u^T v v^T u$. The $vv^T$, we will call $K$, is the face quadric. The distance a vertex is in comparison to its neighbors is then the sum of the face quadrics that touch the vertex. Then we can say that the error of collapsing and edge is the sum of the vertex quadrics at both endpoints of the edge. With this, we want to find the position of new point such that it minimizes the distance to the original surface. We find this by solving $Ku = 0$.</p>
<p>As the first step towards solving the quadric error for an edge, we first found the quadric for each face.</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/face_quadric.png" align="middle" width="800px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Then, for each vertex, we sum all of the surrounding face quadrics. Likewise, each edge is given an error that is the sum of the total quadrics found at both vertices connected by the edge. Since we want to greedily collapse edges with the cheapest error, we make a priority queue that orders edges by this error. In addition, since upsampling scales the number of face by 4, the target number of triangles for downsampling is the number of triangles in the mesh divided by 4. In sum, we</p>
<ol>
	<li> pop off the cheapest edge from the queue
	<li>collapse it
	<li> repeat until the queue is empty of the target number of triangles is reached
</ol>

<h4>
  Isotropic Remeshing: (Implemented by Elizabeth Schafle)
</h4>
<p>
  We implemented incremental remeshing to create a more topologically accurate and regular mesh. We did this through
  enforcing a more regular edge length, improving mesh valence, and centering vertices. For this algorithm, we referenced
  this lecture from CMU <a href="http://www.hao-li.com/cs599-ss2015/slides/Lecture09.1.pdf">Slides</a>
</p>
<p>
  The first part of this algorithm, we specified a length L to be the average length of all of the current edges
  in the mesh. Then, we defined values L_max = 4/3 * L and L_min = 4/5 * L. Then, using L_max, we split all edges longer
  than l_max, ensuring no edges would be too long, and we collapsed any edges that were less than L_min
</p>


<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh1.png" align="middle" width="300px"/>
        <img src="images/remesh2.png" align="middle" width="542px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Enforcing edge lengths resulted in the following change from the original mesh</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh7.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  The next major portion of this algorithm was enforcing optimal valence of the vertices, in other words, we made sure
  that most of the edges in the mesh had no vertex with more or less than 6 incident edges. To do this, we
  iterated through all of the edges in the mesh. For each edge, we first collected all of the vertices that would be involved
  in the flipping of the current edge, A, B, C, and D:
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh3.png" align="middle" width="200px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  Then, using these vertices we used the following formula to compute the total error in the valence of the
  vertices involved with the edge flip:
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/resmesh4.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh5.png" align="middle" width="700px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  Then, with a slightly edited version of this same formula, we calculated the valence error of these vertices if
  we were to flip the current edge. If the predicted valence error was less than the current valence error,
  we flipped the edge.
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh6.png" align="middle" width="700px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  Enforcing an average edge length between average edge length resulted in the following change from the
  previous result:
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh8.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  The final portion of this algorithm was local spring relaxation, or more simply, moving vertices towards
  the centroid of their respective polygons. We did this by first calculating the centroid for each vertex,
  using the average position of its incident vertices:
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh9.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  Next, after computing the centroid of each vertex in the mesh, we iterated through the vertices of the mesh
  and using the vertex normal and centroid, created a difference vector with which to transform the current
  position of the vertex, but we multiply this vector by 4/5 in order to reduce the total distance of position
  change to preserve topology and reduce errors.
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh10.png" align="middle" width="700px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>This final computation resulted in the following improvement to the mesh:</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh11.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  And finally, a comparision of the final result to the original mesh:
</p>


<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/remesh12.png" align="middle" width="700px"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
